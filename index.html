                <p>An overview of CRAP, what it is, and a basic mention of each principle.</p>
                <p>C.R.A.P. stands for Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, and Proximityâ€”four key principles of design
                    outlined by Robin Williams.
                    When designing any visual material, such as a flyer, business card, or newsletter, it's important to
                    consider these principles
                    to create a balanced and effective layout.</p>
                <p>Contrast forms the foundation of effective design. By varying elements like color, size, typography,
                    and other visual
                    aspects, you create emphasis that directs the viewer's attention and enhances their understanding of
                    the content.</p>
                <p>Repetition involves deliberately reusing certain design elements to establish consistency, unity, and
                    coherence. This
                    technique helps users become familiar with your design and strengthens your brand identity. You can
                    apply repetition
                    to various components such as colors, fonts, shapes, and patterns.</p>
                <p>Alignment refers to the arrangement of elements in your design so that they line up in a visually
                    organized and logical
                    manner. Proper alignment helps users follow the flow of information, creating a clean and structured
                    look that is easy
                    to navigate.</p>
                <p>Proximity involves positioning elements in your design to highlight their relationships and create a
                    sense of order. By
                    grouping related items together and spacing out those that are unrelated, you help users navigate
                    the design more intuitively
                    and locate the information they need with ease.</p>

                <p>Explanation of how each page and the quiz works.</p>
                <p>Each page offers an explanation of a specific design principle, along with interactive features that
                    let you adjust the style
                    based on that principle. The quiz page serves as a way to test your understanding by allowing you to
                    modify these design elements,
                    and then it evaluates how effectively you've applied the principles.</p>
